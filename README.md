## Installation

* `npm install` or `yarn`

* `react-native run-ios`

## Usage

The app contains 3 implementations for the use-case shown in the video above. You can compare the implementations side by side. To simulate stress conditions, turn on the toggle. This will make the performance differences between implementations much more evident.
